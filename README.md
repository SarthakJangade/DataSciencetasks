Autocorrect
âž¡Check a word for spelling error.
âž¡Automatically picks the most likely word.

Types of Spelling Errors
âž¡1.Non word errors
Any word not in the dictionary is an error.
Larger dictionary will lead to less non-word spelling errors.
How to correct non word spelling errors?
Let, Given an input word w, generate a of candidate C
w- thew
C={"the","then","there","they","..."}
Pick the word that maximizes the probablity using language model.
argmax P(c|w), for c Alt + 8712 Element of C
E.g.lanuage->> language 


âž¡ 2. Real word errors
1.words with similar pronounciations.
2.Words with similar spelling.
3.Choose the best candidate word.
4.Noisy channel model E.g probablistic model.
Steps :- 
1. Generate candidate words
2. Language Model
3. channel Model
4. Probability of the word
5.For each candidate word, product of the output of language model and channel model.
